After creating static and shared libraries, its time we talked about their complications..

1. What is an soname? What are its usages?

2. Why are only sonames encoded within an executable, rather than an absolute path?

3. What is /etc/ld.so.conf? Explain the mechanism and the cache file /etc/ld.so.cache

4. What is the order in which libraries are loaded? What are the reasons for it?

5. What is LD_LIBRARY_PATH? What can it be used for? Is it a good long-term solution?

6. Explain the 'rpath' method. Compare it to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
