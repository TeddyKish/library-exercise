Finally! Now that I've mastered linking, I may start creating static libraries..

1. What is a static library? How does one create it? What files are located within it?

2. How (and when) does one link a static library to an executable?

3. What are the advantages of a static library?

4. Create a static library named libbeneltavori.a, and a header file beneltavori.h.
   This library should contain the following files, and within them the following functions:

   sing_together.c:
   - void sing() // Perform some sing operation
   - unsigned int calc_earnings(int show_type) // Return the amount of money earned in a concert of type <show_type>

   sing_alone.c
   - int breakup() // Declare a static local variable within the function, initialize it with 0, and return it
   - void start_solo_career() // Prints "I'm going solo" then does nothing and returns.

   Include the relevant declarations within beneltavori.h.
   Build sing_together.c and sing_alone.c into the static library.

5. Create a main.cpp file that includes the beneltavori header.
   Create a roadmap of static and ben el's career using the interface within the header.
   Make sure to call <start_solo_career> last.

   Print the roadmap within the main.cpp file.
   Include your build command within the solution.
