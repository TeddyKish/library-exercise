Alas, it is time to show the world the true victor between rpath and LD_LIBRARY_PATH!

1. Create two libraries with the same name- libplane.so.
    Implement the void fly(void) function within both libraries, and provide different printings.

2. Create an executable that uses "libplane.so" and links with it dynamically (not in runtime).

3. Show how different values of LD_LIBRARY_PATH control the functionality of the executable.

4. Build two different executables, each with an rpath that points to a different directory.
	Place the different instances of libplane.so in the different directories.

	Now, pick one of the executables and its corresponding directory that contains its instance of libplane.so.
	Verify that even if you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the other directory containing the other instance of libplane.so, the functionality isn't changed.


Include the build commands in your solution!
