Shared libraries are so strange. 
All of these different flags in compilation... What are they?
Lazy binding, GOT, PLT... man, I've got to finally understand what they mean!

1. What is position independent code? What is a position independent executable?

2. What do the flags -fPIC and -fpic do? What is the difference between them?

3. What are the GOT & PLT? How are they involved in the "lazy binding" process?
